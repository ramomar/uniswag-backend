      |Yet among all the distractions and diversions
      |of a planet which now seemed well on the way to becoming one vast playground,

      |The world’s now placid, featureless, and culturally dead:
      |nothing really new has been created since the Overlords came.
      |The reason’s obvious.
      |There’s nothing left to struggle for,
      |and there are too many distractions and entertainments.
      |Do you realize that every day something like five hundred hours of radio and TV pour out
      |over the various channels?
      |No wonder that
      |people are becoming passive sponges – absorbing but never creating.
      |Did you know that the average viewing time per person is now three hours a day?
      |Soon people won’t be living their own lives any more.
      |It will be a full-time job keeping up with the various family serials on TV!

      |As you doubtless know, Sir,
      |one of the great problems of our culture has been the dichotomy between art and science.
      |Do you subscribe to the view that all artists are abnormal?
      |That their work – or at any rate the impulse behind it –
      |is the result of some deep-seated psychological dissatisfaction?
      |I’ve been told that all men are artists to a certain extent,
      |so that everyone is capable of creating something, if only on a rudimentary level.
      |At your schools yesterday, for example, I noticed the emphasis placed on
      |self-expression in drawing, painting, and modeling.
      |The impulse seemed quite universal,
      |even among those clearly destined to be specialists in science.
      |So if all artists are abnormal, and all men are artists, we have an interesting syllogism...

      |As to the nature of that change, we can tell you very little.
      |We do not know how it is produced – what trigger impulse the Overmind employs when it judges
      |that the time is ripe.
      |All we have discovered is that it starts with a single individual – always a child –
      |and then spreads explosively, like the formation of crystals round the first nucleus in a
      |saturated solution.
      |Adults will not be affected, for their minds are already set in an unalterable mold.

      |In a few years, it will all be over, and the human race will have divided in twain.

      |You have given birth to your successors,

      |It would be simplest, and perhaps most merciful,

      |But this I cannot do. Your future will be your own to choose in the
      |years that are left to you.

      |childish toys – yet it is something wonderful, and you will have created it.
      |When our race is forgotten, part of yours will still exist.

      |Television, radio, and all the sources of amusement and information that surround us in our
      |daily lives are also artificial props.
